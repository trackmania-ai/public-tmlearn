**About PedroAI**  
tmlearn is part of the PedroAI project
([trackmania-ai](https://github.com/trackmania-ai) on github), which I
began in April 2020. I streamed AI training on
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pedroaitm) from April 2021 to September
2023. Iâ€™ve since moved on to other projects and decided to open-source
PedroAI. For more details, check the
[blog](https://www.trackmania.ai/blog/).

**Platform & Tools**  
tmlearn is intended for Linux (tested on Ubuntu 23.04) and uses
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/getting_started.html) for development.

## Requirements

Have conda, tmenv, pytorch, torchvision installed.

- Install tmenv from https://github.com/trackmania-ai/tmenv.
- I use miniconda to install conda
  https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.
- I install pytorch and torchvision following
  https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

## Installing

tmlearn is not packaged yet and require an [editable
install](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064426/when-would-the-e-editable-option-be-useful-with-pip-install).
To install clone this repo and run: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
