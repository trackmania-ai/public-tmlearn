    "tmlearn is part of the PedroAI project ([trackmania-ai](https://github.com/trackmania-ai) on github), which I began in April 2020. I streamed AI training on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pedroaitm) from April 2021 to September 2023. I've since moved on to other projects and decided to open-source PedroAI. For more details, check the [blog](https://www.trackmania.ai/blog/).\n",

    "tmlearn is intended for Linux (tested on Ubuntu 23.04) and uses [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/getting_started.html) for development."
